--> compiler error[E001]: DUPLICATE NAME

Duplicate binding: `count` is already defined.

  --> examples/error_messages/immutable_binding.flx:5:1
  |
5 | let count = 0;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hint:
  Use a different name or remove the previous definition.

   = note: first defined here

--> compiler error[E002]: IMMUTABLE BINDING

Cannot reassign to immutable variable `count`.

  --> examples/error_messages/immutable_binding.flx:9:1
  |
9 | count = count + 1;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hint:
  In Flux, bindings are immutable. Compute a new value with a new binding name (for example: `let next_count = ...`).
