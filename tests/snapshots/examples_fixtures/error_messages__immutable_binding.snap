--> compiler error[E002]: IMMUTABLE BINDING

Cannot reassign to immutable variable `count`.

  --> examples/error_messages/immutable_binding.flx:9:1

9 | count = count + 1;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hint:
  In Flux, bindings are immutable. Compute a new value with a new binding name (for example: `let next_count = ...`).
