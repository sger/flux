--> compiler error[E004]: UNDEFINED VARIABLE

I can't find a value named `undefined_var`.

  --> examples/optimizations/free_variables.flx:9:19
  |
9 | let result1 = x + undefined_var;
  |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hint:
  Define it first: let undefined_var = ...;


--> compiler error[E004]: UNDEFINED VARIABLE

I can't find a value named `missing`.

  --> examples/optimizations/free_variables.flx:16:21
   |
16 |     let c = a + b + missing;
   |                     ^^^^^^^

Hint:
  Define it first: let missing = ...;


Help:
  Did you mean `is_int`?
