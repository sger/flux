--> compiler error[E001]: DUPLICATE NAME

Duplicate binding: `count` is already defined.

  --> examples/suggestions/test_suggestions.flx:3:1
  |
3 | let count = 10;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hint:
  Use a different name or remove the previous definition.

   = note: first defined here
  --> examples/suggestions/test_suggestions.flx:0:1

--> compiler error[E004]: UNDEFINED VARIABLE

I can't find a value named `coun`.

  --> examples/suggestions/test_suggestions.flx:8:7
  |
8 | print(coun);
  |       ^^^^

Hint:
  Define it first: let coun = ...;


Help:
  Did you mean one of: `count`, `counter`, `join`?

Found 2 errors.
