// Constant folding optimization example
// These constant expressions will be folded at compile-time

// Integer arithmetic
let a = 2 + 3 * 4;          // Folded to: 14
let b = (10 + 5) * 2;       // Folded to: 30
let c = 100 / 4 - 5;        // Folded to: 20

// Float arithmetic
let pi_approx = 3.14 * 2.0; // Folded to: 6.28
let ratio = 22.0 / 7.0;     // Folded to: 3.142857...

// String concatenation
let greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World";  // Folded to: "Hello World"

// Boolean logic
let always_true = true || false;   // Folded to: true
let always_false = false && true;  // Folded to: false

// Comparisons
let is_equal = 5 == 5;       // Folded to: true
let is_less = 3 < 10;        // Folded to: true
let is_greater = 7 > 2;      // Folded to: true

// Negation
let negative = -42;          // Folded to: -42
let not_true = !true;        // Folded to: false

// Complex nested expressions
let complex = (2 + 3) * (4 - 1) + 10 / 2;  // Folded to: 20

// Note: Expressions with variables are NOT folded
let x = 10;
let y = x + 5;  // NOT folded (x is a variable)
