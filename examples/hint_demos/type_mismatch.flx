// This example demonstrates hint positioning for type mismatches
// The error will show where variables with incompatible types were defined

let name = "Alice";    // String type
let age = 25;          // Int type
let height = 165;      // Int type

// This will work: both are integers
let sum = age + height;

// This will error: can't add String and Int
// Hints will point to where 'name' (String) and 'age' (Int) were defined
let invalid = name + age;

sum
